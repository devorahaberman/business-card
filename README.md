# Digital Business Card

This is a GitHub repo that acts as my digital business card. It shares a little about me and how to get in touch.

## What's Inside

- Identical images to my physical business card
- Links to email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and other profiles  
- Clean and simple design that works on phones and computers

## How to Use

To see it on your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/digital-business-card.git
cd digital-business-card
open index.html
```

Or visit the live site if it's published online.
